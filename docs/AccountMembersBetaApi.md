> ### Full use of this API resource is an Enterprise feature > > The ability to perform a partial update to multiple members is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. If you are on another plan, you can update members individually. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).  Perform a partial update to multiple members. Updating members uses the semantic patch format.  To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/api#updates-using-semantic-patch).  ### Instructions  Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating members.  <details> <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating members</strong></summary>  #### replaceMembersRoles  Replaces the roles of the specified members.

Here\'s an example:  ```json {   \"instructions\": [{     \"kind\": \"replaceMemberRoles\",     \"value\": \"reader\",     \"memberIDs\": [       \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\",       \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\"     ]   }] } ```  #### replaceAllMembersRoles  Replaces the roles of all members.
